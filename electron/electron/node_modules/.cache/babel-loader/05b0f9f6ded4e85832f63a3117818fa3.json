{"ast":null,"code":"// Phoenix Channels JavaScript client\n//\n// ## Socket Connection\n//\n// A single connection is established to the server and\n// channels are multiplexed over the connection.\n// Connect to the server using the `Socket` class:\n//\n//     let socket = new Socket(\"/socket\", {params: {userToken: \"123\"}})\n//     socket.connect()\n//\n// The `Socket` constructor takes the mount point of the socket,\n// the authentication params, as well as options that can be found in\n// the Socket docs, such as configuring the heartbeat.\n//\n// ## Channels\n//\n// Channels are isolated, concurrent processes on the server that\n// subscribe to topics and broker events between the client and server.\n// To join a channel, you must provide the topic, and channel params for\n// authorization. Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n// events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n// the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n//\n//     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n//     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n//     $input.onEnter( e => {\n//       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n//        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n//        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n//        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n//     })\n//     channel.join()\n//       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n//       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n//       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Joining\n//\n// Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n// `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n// Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n// updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n// Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n// receive \"error\".\n//\n// ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n//\n// While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n// the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n// given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n// the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n// spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n// `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n// channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n//\n// ## Pushing Messages\n//\n// From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n// can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n// receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n// `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n//  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n//\n//\n// ## Socket Hooks\n//\n// Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n// `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n//\n//     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n//     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Channel Hooks\n//\n// For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n// to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n//\n//     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n//     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n//\n// ### onError hooks\n//\n// `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n// crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n// automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n//\n// ### onClose hooks\n//\n// `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n// closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n// `channel.leave()`\n//\n//\n// ## Presence\n//\n// The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n// from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n//\n// ### Syncing initial state from the server\n//\n// `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n// with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n// be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n// disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n//\n// `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n// events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n// accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n// joining or leaving from a device.\n//\n// ### Listing Presences\n//\n// `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n// based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n// metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n// allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n// For example, you may have a user online from different devices with\n// a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n// on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the \"away\"\n// status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n// function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n// each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n// they came online from:\n//\n//     let state = {}\n//     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n//     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n//       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n//       first.id = id\n//       return first\n//     }\n//     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n//\n//\n// ### Example Usage\n//\n//     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n//     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n//       if(!current){\n//         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n//       } else {\n//         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n//       }\n//     }\n//     // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present\n//     let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {\n//       if(current.metas.length === 0){\n//         console.log(\"user has left from all devices\", leftPres)\n//       } else {\n//         console.log(\"user left from a device\", leftPres)\n//       }\n//     }\n//     let presences = {} // client's initial empty presence state\n//     // receive initial presence data from server, sent after join\n//     myChannel.on(\"presence_state\", state => {\n//       presences = Presence.syncState(presences, state, onJoin, onLeave)\n//       displayUsers(Presence.list(presences))\n//     })\n//     // receive \"presence_diff\" from server, containing join/leave events\n//     myChannel.on(\"presence_diff\", diff => {\n//       presences = Presence.syncDiff(presences, diff, onJoin, onLeave)\n//       this.setState({users: Presence.list(room.presences, listBy)})\n//     })\n//\nmodule.exports = {\n  Channel: require('./channel'),\n  Socket: require('./socket'),\n  Presence: require('./presence')\n};","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
